# Bot-Creator-BC
Create your own bot without coding! (No hosting required â€“ the bot only runs from your computer.)

Installing Python is not required, but it is needed to support modules since the bot itself does nothing on its own.
Required libraries:

- _**disnake**_
- Other libraries that may be needed for various **unofficial modules**.
